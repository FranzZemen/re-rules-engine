# Read Me

The @franzzemen/rulesEngine framework is a rules engine with a text based interface for maximum usability, and referred in the
documentation as the RulesEngine Engine. It can also be referred to by its singleton name ReRulesEngine.Engine.

## Pre-requisites

### Node / Browser Version

Node versions 16.x + are supported

Until we test and release either updates to support a browser version or release separate package supporting browsers we
make no commitments whether it can be loaded in a browser.

### Javascript Target

The Javascript target is ECMAScript 2021 (es2021 tsc target option).

The module resolution to load this package is ECMAScript which is now the standard. A helpful package,
[@franzzemen/rulesEngine-commonjs-examples](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@franzzemen/re-commonjs-examples), has been provided in
npm and github on how to integrate into a CommonJS loaded project.

For alternatives Javascript targets or for CommonJS see [this](./ts-src/JavascriptTargetAndModuleResolution.md).

## Install

    npm i @franzzemen/rulesEngine

For what this installs, and other packages, see [here](./ts-src/InstalledAndSisterPackages.md).
