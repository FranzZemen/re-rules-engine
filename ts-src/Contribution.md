# Contribution

We welcome contributors. We see contributors falling into 3 categories:

- Amateur contributors..."I need to do this/to fix this bug" contributors:  These are users out there that have
  encountered something they need to fix/add/modify desperately enough that they bothered to research and propose a fix.
  The pull requests are least likely to be sharpened to our quality standards, but are likely the most important to work
  on, as they represent real people needing real things.
- Professional contributors, who enjoys the package and wants to make material/significant contributions to the
  codebase. These contributors are extremely valuable, but fall into a spectrum of maturity on the framework, and line
  by line reviews of their contribution is critical.
- Trusted contributor, who is given the keys to review and incorporate pull requests. A rare breed. someone who most
  likely uses the package at a professional level as an expert, and has a vested interest in its future.  
  Trusted contributors sign a contract to protect that protects the future direction of the framework.  Trust 
  contributors are Github Collaborators

99% of contributors are Amateur, and we welcome and value them!
