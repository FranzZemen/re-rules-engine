# Release Notes

## Versions/Tagging

Obtaining the latest @franzzemen/rulesEngine package will provide the latest code that passes tests. Expect npm package
versioning to be fairly chatty, as we make strong use of semver and publish new changes aggressively and in as small
increments as possible, and because we like to remain on the latest third party packages as possible.

On a less frequent basis the code will be tagged to specific versions. Tagged versions can be considered more trusted
than npm package versions.

At this time the code base is tagged as "Alpha". Differences between "Alpha" releases will not be fully documented.

Only the top-most packages (Examples: rulesEngine, rulesEngine-cli, rulesEngine-standard-functions) are tagged with publicly useful tags.  
Dependencies are managed through the top packages package.json files. This avoids accidentally mis-managing dependent
package tags, which would cause headaches for users.
